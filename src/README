This folder contains source files for Norwegian Bokm√•l.

Installation and compilation, and a short note on usage,
is documented in the file INSTALL.

Documentation is scattered around on giellateknos pages, e.g.
* http://giellatekno.uit.no/faodoc/index.html
* http://giellatekno.uit.no/doc/tools/docu-sme-manual.html

The folder contains two different dis files, 
tt-nob-dis.rle 
nob-dis.rle
The former is obsolete and should not be used.
