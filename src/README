----

Installation and compilation, and a short note on usage,
is documented in the file INSTALL.


The folder contains two different dis files, 
tt-nob-dis.rle 
nob-dis.rle

The former is obsolete and should not be used.
The latter is taken from the Oslo-Bergen tagger, released under GPL.


The nob.fst is based on a wordform list, and contains lots of errors.
