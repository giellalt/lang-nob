# The OBT-Giellatekno Bokmål Norwegian disambiguator 

This disambiguator is based upon the disambiguator from OBT
(Oslo-Bergen-taggeren), hereafter OBT-cg. It is adjusted to the GiellaLT FST and
extended with several rules. It contains
the morphological rules only.

The original OBT disambiguator was written in CG-1 by Kristin Hagen and
Anders Nøklestad at UiO. It was translated to CG-2 by Lars Nygård.
The conversion to CG-3 and the Tromsø format was done by Trond Trosterud.


## Delimiters and sets

The tagsets are a superset of the OBT and GiellaLT tags, so that 
the labels are kept from OBT-cg, but GiellaLT content is added when needed.

### Giellatekno early rules

**NotAbbr** removes abbreviations whenever alternatives

**AbbrBeforePara** removes CLB before CLB

**Nynorsk** removes all *+Nynorsk* forms (they are in use only for the dictionary interface, and that does not use disambiguation).

**aaIM** selects +IM for *å*

#### Numerals








* Rule for adding <vdic> to verbs denoting verbal actions like: ... dadjá Aili Kestkitalo.
