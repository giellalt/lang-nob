This is a grammatical analyser for Bokm√•l Norwegian.

It was originally made based on a wordform list 
(in times before lemma lists were available), and thus
contains many misclassified lemmas. Here, we use it since
it is flexible, partly for e-dictionaries, and partly for
generating frequency lists.

The analyser cannot be used for normative purposes.

These pages document how to build the parsers. If you want to know
how to use them on the command line, read the
