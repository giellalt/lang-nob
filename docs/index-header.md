This page documents the work on the [Norwegian Bokmål language model](http://github.com/giellalt/lang-nob). It was originally made based on a wordform list 
(in times before lemma lists were available), and thus
contains many misclassified lemmas. Here, we use it since
it is flexible, partly for e-dictionaries, and partly for
generating frequency lists.

The analyser cannot be used for normative purposes.

Giellatekno's main focus is on the Saami langauges and other circumpolar
minority languages. As part of our work we need to build bilingual
resources. This is where Norwegian comes in. For analysing Norwegian we
either use the Oslo-Bergen tagger, or we use our own resources.

# Documentation on the Norwegian analyser Oslo-Bergen-taggeren

The Oslo-Bergen tagger is available for Bokmål and Nynorsk. It has [an
official webpage](http://tekstlab.uio.no/obt-ny/), where it is available
under GPL, this documentation is for the Giellatekno in-house use of it.

# Documentation on our own resources for Norwegian

The analysers are modeled like all the other Giellatekno languages.

Our Norwegian analyser was an auxiliary device made for analysing
Norwegian at a time when the Oslo-Bergen tagger was not freely
available. It is based upon a huge wordform list, most of which has been
manually converted to lemma/stem-based lexc format. One should also
consider using the Oslo-Bergen tagger instead or our analyser.

Our disambiguator (The syntax file above) is based upon the Oslo-Bergen
tagger, with some improvements
