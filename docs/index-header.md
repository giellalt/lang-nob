This page documents the work on the [Norwegian Bokmål language model](http://github.com/giellalt/lang-nob). It was originally made based on a wordform list 
(in times before lemma lists were available), and thus
contains many misclassified lemmas. Here, we use it since
it is flexible, partly for e-dictionaries, and partly for
generating frequency lists.

The analyser cannot be used for normative purposes.

Giellatekno's main focus is on the Saami langauges and other circumpolar
minority languages. As part of our work we need to build bilingual
resources. This is where Norwegian comes in. For analysing Norwegian we
either use the Oslo-Bergen tagger, or we use our own resources.

## The language model

### Morphology and morphophonology

Our Norwegian bokmål language model was an auxiliary device made for analysing Norwegian at a time when the Oslo-Bergen FST was not freely
available. It is based upon a huge wordform list, most of which has been
manually converted to lemma/stem-based lexc format. The source files are documented below.

### The disambiguator

Our disambiguator is based upon the Oslo-Bergen tagger disambiguator, with some adjustments. The Oslo-Bergen tagger is available for Bokmål and Nynorsk. It has [an
official webpage](http://tekstlab.uio.no/obt-ny/), where it is available
under GPL The Giellatekno adapted version of it is documented below.
